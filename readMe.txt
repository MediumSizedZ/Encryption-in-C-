This is a program that can encrypt a string using a Caesar Cipher.

How it works:
1) Enter a string and press enter (Ex: Marco? Polo!)
2) Enter a random number between 1 and 26 and press enter (if any other number is entered, the program prompts you to enter the correct number)
3) Press enter

The program will then encrypt the letters of the string, excluding punctuation, spaces, numbers, and other symbols

(Ex: "Marco? Polo!" with a number 5 entered becomes "Rfwht? Utqt!")
